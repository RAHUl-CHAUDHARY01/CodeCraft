Here’s the workflow using `my-new-feature` for developing a new feature:

## Workflow with Commands

### 1. **Start from `main`**
   - Make sure you're on the `main` branch and it's up-to-date.
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   ```

### 2. **Create a new feature branch from `main`**
   - Create a feature-specific branch directly from `main`. This isolates your feature development from the rest of the codebase.
   ```bash
   git checkout -b my-new-feature
   ```

### 3. **Develop your feature**
   - As you develop, add and commit changes regularly.
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Progress on my feature"
   ```

   - Push your feature branch to the remote to back it up.
   ```bash
   git push origin my-new-feature
   ```

### 4. **Periodically sync with `main`**
   - To avoid your feature branch becoming too different from `main`, periodically pull changes from `main` and merge them into your feature branch.
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main     # Get the latest main updates
   git checkout my-new-feature
   git merge main           # Merge latest changes from main into your feature branch
   ```

   - Resolve any conflicts that arise during the merge, commit the resolution, and continue working on your feature.

### 5. **Complete the feature and merge it into `main`**
   - Once your feature is complete, make sure the feature branch is up-to-date with `main` one last time:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main      # Get latest main
   git checkout my-new-feature
   git merge main            # Ensure feature branch is up-to-date with main
   ```

   - After resolving any conflicts, switch to `main` and merge your feature branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git merge my-new-feature   # Merge the feature branch into main
   ```

### 6. **Push `main` to the remote**
   - Push the merged changes to the remote `main` branch.
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```

### 7. **Delete the feature branch**
   - After successfully merging the feature branch into `main`, delete the feature branch locally and remotely to keep the branch list clean:
   ```bash
   git branch -d my-new-feature          # Delete the feature branch locally
   git push origin --delete my-new-feature  # Delete the feature branch from the remote
   ```

---

## Recap of the Workflow:
- **Create a new feature branch from `main`** when starting a new feature.
- **Periodically merge `main` into the feature branch** to keep it updated and reduce merge conflicts.
- **Merge the feature branch back into `main`** once the feature is complete.
- **Delete the feature branch** after merging to keep the repository clean.

This approach keeps feature-specific branches isolated from each other and ensures that `main` remains stable.
